In This research project, we completed these steps:
- Collected total ```785 Ultra-Sound images``` from multiple subjects. 
-  ```Labeled and prepare segmentation``` the images under expert supervision.
- ```Pre-process``` (Normalize and resize) the images. 
-  train and validate the model over multiple machine-learning and deep-learning based algorithm including .
