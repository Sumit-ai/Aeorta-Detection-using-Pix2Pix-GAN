In This research project, we completed these steps:
- Collected total ```785 Ultra-Sound images``` from multiple subjects. 
-  ```Labeled and prepare segmentation``` the images under expert supervision.
- ```Pre-process``` (Normalize and resize) the images. 
-  train and validate the model over multiple machine-learning and deep-learning based algorithm including .



## Libraries:
``` python 
import numpy 
import tensorflow 
import keras
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import glob 
import keras 

```
## Results: 
We compared all 5 models:

Plot 1:
