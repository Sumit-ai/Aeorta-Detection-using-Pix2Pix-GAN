# Aeorta-Detection-using-Pix2Pix-GAN
In This research project, we completed these steps:
1) Collected total ``785 Ultra-Sound images``` from multiple subjects. 
2) ```Labeled and prepare segmentation``` the images under expert supervision.
3) ```Pre-process``` (Normalize and resize) the images. 
4) train and validate the model over multiple machine-learning and deep-learning based algorithm including .
